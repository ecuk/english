English keyboard layout for OS X

This is an English keyboard layout for authors instead of programmers. In particular, it is much better for writing English using Markdown. It is based upon the standard OS X British keyboard layout with the following changes:

- [ and ] generate inverted commas ‘ and ’
- { and } generate double inverted commas “ and ”
- [ and ] are option-[ and option-]
- { and } are option-shift-{ and option-shift-}
- £ (shift-3) ==> # (because # is used for Markdown headings)
- £ is option-3

Roughly, the [ and ] keys have had their standard option- and non-option- bindings swapped, although for some idiotic reason Apple originally put the single inverted commas on one key (with and without shift) and the double inverted commas on the key next to it, whereas all other pairs of open- and close- delimiters are on keys next to each other. This layout makes much more sense, at least to me.
